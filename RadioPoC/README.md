Proof of concept for radiomap.ftl handling value attributes different between 2.5.22 and 6.3.0.1.

Change the struts version between 2.5.32 and 6.3.0.1 and restart the jetty application, then refresh localhost:8080/RadioPoC/index (case sensitive). In 2.5.32, the first radio, which uses a bare value instead of an explicit ognl reference, will have the checked property set, in 6.3.0.1 it won't be set. the second radio will always have the checked property set.
